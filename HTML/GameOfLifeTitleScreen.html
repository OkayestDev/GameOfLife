            Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation. <br>
            Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. <br>
            Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
            Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br>
